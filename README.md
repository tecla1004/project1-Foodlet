# Foodlet
Spring Term 2022 - Team 5 - Integrated Project
Langara College

# Description
The Foodlet project aims to tackle the pressing issue of food waste while simultaneously providing users with an opportunity to access delicious, discounted meals from nearby restaurants. Food waste is a significant global problem, with tons of edible food discarded daily by restaurants, contributing to environmental issues. Foodlet seeks to revolutionize the way surplus food is handled by connecting users with local restaurants, allowing them to order leftover food at discounted prices. By doing so, the project not only reduces food waste but also ensures that users can enjoy high-quality meals at reasonable prices, promoting sustainability and benefiting both businesses and the environment.
